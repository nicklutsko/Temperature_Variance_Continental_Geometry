# Temperature_Variance_Continental_Geometry

This repo contains the Jupyter notebook used in the analysis of "Continental Geometryâ€™s Role in Shaping Wintertime Temperature Variance" by Neumann and Lutsko. This notebook analyzes data from idealized simulations used to explore how varying continental geometry impacts wintertime temperature variance. All simulatins were run with the [ISCA](https://execlim.github.io/IscaWebsite/) modeling framework, using the gray radiation set-up. Please contact [Nicole Neumann](https://lamont.columbia.edu/directory/nicole-neumann) directly for namelist files.
